              <h3>HTML 5</h3>
              <p>
                Welcome to our HTML course! We’re excited to have you here as
                you begin your journey into the world of web development. HTML,
                or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of every webpage
                you see on the internet. It’s the foundation that structures the
                content of your site, and understanding HTML is the first
                essential step in becoming a proficient web developer. In this
                course, we’ll guide you through the core concepts and elements
                of HTML, starting with the basics and progressing to more
                advanced techniques. You’ll learn how to create headings,
                paragraphs, images, links, forms, and tables, as well as how to
                properly structure a webpage using HTML tags and attributes.
                Along the way, you’ll also gain an understanding of semantic
                HTML, which ensures your websites are not only user-friendly but
                also accessible and SEO-friendly.

              <h3>CSS - Cascading stylesheet</h3>
              <p>
                Welcome to our CSS course! We're excited to have you here as you
                dive into the world of styling and design for the web. CSS, or
                Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that brings structure to
                life, allowing you to transform plain HTML into visually
                stunning websites. Whether you’re a complete beginner or looking
                to expand your knowledge, this course will equip you with the
                skills to create beautiful, responsive web designs. In this
                course, we’ll start by introducing you to the fundamental
                concepts of CSS, including selectors, properties, and values.
                You’ll learn how to apply styles to elements, control layout
                with positioning and margins, and customize fonts, colors, and
                backgrounds to create eye-catching designs.

                Welcome to our JavaScript course! We’re thrilled to have you
                here as you explore the dynamic world of programming and
                interactive web development. JavaScript is the powerful language
                that adds functionality and interactivity to websites,
                transforming static pages into engaging and responsive
                experiences. Whether you’re just starting to learn coding or
                looking to enhance your skills, this course will provide you
                with the knowledge and tools to harness the full potential of
                JavaScript. In this course, we’ll begin by introducing you to
                the foundational concepts of JavaScript, including variables,
                data types, operators, and control structures like loops and
                conditionals. You'll learn how to create interactive features
                such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and
                event-driven actions that respond to user interactions. As you
                advance, we’ll cover more complex topics like functions,
                objects, arrays, and error handling, helping you become
                proficient in writing clean and efficient JavaScript code.
